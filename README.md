# FileSystem with FUSE

## Introduction to FUSE

<b>FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)</b> is an interface that allows userspace programs to create virtual filesystems and interact with the Linux kernel. It provides a secure way for non-privileged users to develop and mount their own filesystem implementations. Originally a part of AVFS, FUSE was heavily influenced by the translator concept of the GNU Hurd.

## How FUSE Works

To create a custom filesystem using FUSE, a userspace program must be written and linked with the libfuse library. This program defines how the filesystem responds to operations such as reading, writing, and retrieving file metadata (stat). Additionally, it is responsible for mounting the filesystem. Once mounted, the kernel forwards all I/O requests to the userspace handler, which processes them and sends responses back to the user.

## Use Cases

FUSE is particularly useful for developing virtual filesystems, enabling users to:

- Create network-based or encrypted filesystems.

- Implement cloud storage integrations.

- Develop filesystem abstractions for specific applications.

- Access non-native file formats as regular files.

With its flexibility and security, FUSE is widely used for various specialized filesystem solutions in Linux environments.
